THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT.

## Program

Both of these programs have the standard VHDL structure, with their low-level build, their high-level build and the testers, although the second one is lacking some structuring. I really appreciate this programming language, and any other with such a specific purpose. Also, I like electronic logic. Unfortunately, this language doesn't have the commodities that other more popular ones have.  
I have omitted some files from the project that contained some personal information, so the projects might need some building to be "run".
